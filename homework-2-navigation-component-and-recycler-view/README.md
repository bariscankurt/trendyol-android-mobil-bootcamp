### Homework 2 - Navigation Component and RecyclerView

For this homework, i moved to using Fragments instead of Activities to represent project's screens. We did that for login screen in that week's lectures. In this homework i did the same for Signup screen. I also integrated Navigation component to switch between different screens. 

Includes:

* SignupFragment instead of SingupActivity
* Nav_graph.xml for all screens
* RecyclerView for related products section in ProductDetailFragment
* Generating function for related product items
* Click listener for related product section to be able to go item's detail screen when we click on any product inside of related products
